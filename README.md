## Informed Scientific Sampling in Large-scale Outdoor Environments


In this workshop, we aim to discuss recent progress in the field of robotic sampling for monitoring large-scale outdoor environments such as forests, bodies of water, agricultural fields, and complex urban settings.  This workshop is aimed at providing an overview of the research related to field robotics. We plan to discuss a series of research issues that span theoretical, field, and applied topics such as:  measurement acquisition and evaluation, building robust field robots, multi-robot teams, data fusion, environment monitoring. Regardless of the application, all of these tasks aim at efficient and robust information acquisition with autonomous or semi-autonomous technology.

## Topics of interest for this workshop:

#### Informed Sampling
- Active sampling
- Informed path planning
- Trade-offs between exploration and exploitation   
- Data transfer between tasks and developing meaningful priors  

#### Field Robotics
- Field robotic applications: aerial, urban, forest, marine, etc
- Sensor networks
- Creating robotic systems for challenging environments 
- Multi-robot coordination  
- Large-scale mapping  
- Mapping with scientific sensors  

#### Applications
- Search and rescue
- Pollution monitoring
- Environment sensing  
- Cities and humans  
- Disaster recovery  
- Wildlife tracking  
- Collaborating with scientists  
- Scientific data analysis

## Submission Instructions

Authors may submit extended abstracts or full papers in the IROS format (2-6 pages plus references). We encourage the submission of early ideas, late-breaking results, or open research questions that are likely to generate interesting discussions. Submissions of recent or soon-to-be published papers (including IROS 2019) are encouraged.  Submissions will be reviewed by experts in the field.  Accepted papers will be made available through the workshop website and will be invited to present their work at the workshop on Nov 8.
